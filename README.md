# mcService
A simple service I wrote to run minecraft java servers under a linux systemd service

# installation

## preparations
check if you have `screen` installed, if it isn't pleas install the screen package by running:
```bash
sudo apt install screen
```

## automatic installation script
For automatic installation copy the following line and run it in the terminal.
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Quantum-Coder826/mcService/master/installer.sh | tr -d '\r' | bash
```
>**note**
> The install script is kinda dumb so it might fail.

## manual installation
- Create the following folder if it does not exist: `~/.config/systemd/user/`
- Copy/download the `mc@.service` file to that folder.
- Create a `minecraft` folder in your home directory.

# How to use

## Adding a server
Adding servers is easy create a sub-dir in the `~/minecraft` folder. Inside the sub-dir you can install your sever. Ensure the folder contains a `run.sh` and it is marked as executable (coloured <span style="color:green">green</span> when using the `ls` command in bash)
Most servers or modpacks will contain one just make ik executable using the `chmod +x run.sh` command.
After installing your server the tree listing should look something like this:
```
user@server ~/minecraft$ tree -dL 1 ~/minecraft/
/home/user/minecraft/
|-- Create
|-- MechanicalMastery-1.3.0
|   |-- banned-ips.json
|   |-- banned-players.json
|   |-- config
|   |-- defaultconfigs
|   |-- eula.txt
|   |-- icon.png
|   |-- kubejs
|   |-- libraries
|   |-- local
|   |-- logs
|   |-- mods
|   |-- ops.json
|   |-- packmenu
|   |-- patchouli_books
|   |-- quests_structures
|   |-- rhino.local.properties
|   |-- run.sh
|   |-- server.properties
|   |-- skyblock_exports
|   |-- user_jvm_args.txt
|   |-- usercache.json
|   |-- usernamecache.json
|   |-- whitelist.json
|   `-- world
|-- architect
|-- createTogether
|-- encrypted
|-- expert
`-- more

7 directories
```

The important part is the `run.sh`. It is used to start the server, ensure it is marked as execute using `chmod +x ./run.sh`. Most server downloads or modpacks will provide this file.
